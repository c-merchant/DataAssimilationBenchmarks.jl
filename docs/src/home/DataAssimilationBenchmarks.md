# Global Types 
The following type and type constructors are declared for optimizing numerical routines,
for using multiple dispatch of functions with different specified input forms and for
passing arguments between inner / outer loop steps of the DA twin experiment. Type
constructors are designed to be flexible enough to handle multiple dispactch for
automatic code differentiation, though seek to ensure type consistency within mehtods
for improved performance.
