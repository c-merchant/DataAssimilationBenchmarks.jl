# SmootherExps 

All experiments are funcitonalized so that they can be called from an array of parameter
values which will typically be varied with naive parallelism.  Relevant arguments and
experimental results are dumped as a side effect to a dictionary in a JLD2.
Experiments return their runtime in minutes.
