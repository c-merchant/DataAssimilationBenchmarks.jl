# Ensemble Kalman Schemes

## API for data assimilation solvers
There are currently four families of data assimilation solvers available in this package,
which define the outer-loop of the data assimilation cycle.  Particularly, these define
how the sequential data assimilation cycle will pass over a time series of observations.
Ensemble filters run only forward-in-time.  The classic lag-shift smoother runs identically
to the filter in its forecast and filter steps, but includes an additional retrospective
analysis to past ensemble states stored in memory.  The single iteration smoother follows
the same convention as the classic smoother, except in that new cycles are initiated from
a past, reanlyzed ensemble state.  The Gauss-Newton iterative smoothers are 4D smoothers,
which iteratively optimize the initial condition at the beginning of a data assimilation
cycle, and propagate this initial condition to initialize the subsequent cycle. A full
discussion of these methods can be found in
[Grudzien, et al. 2021](https://gmd.copernicus.org/preprints/gmd-2021-306/).

For each outer-loop method defining the data assimilation cycle, different types of analyses
can be specified within their arguments.  Likewise, these outer-loop methods require
arguments such as the ensemble state or the range of ensemble states to analyze, an
observation to assimilate or a range of observations to assimilate, as the observation
operator and observation error covariance and key word arguments for running the
underlying dynamical state model. Examples of the syntax are below:

```{julia}
ensemble_filter(analysis::String, ens::ArView(T), obs::VecA(T), obs_cov::CovM(T),
    kwargs::StepKwargs) where T <: Float64

ls_smoother_classic(analysis::String, ens::ArView(T), obs::ArView(T), obs_cov::CovM(T),
    kwargs::StepKwargs) where T <: Float64

ls_smoother_single_iteration(analysis::String, ens::ArView(T), obs::ArView(T),
    kwargs::StepKwargs) where T <: Float64

ls_smoother_gauss_newton(analysis::String, ens::ArView(T), obs::ArView(T), obs_cov::CovM(T),
    kwargs::StepKwargs; Ïµ::Float64=0.0001, tol::Float64=0.001,
    max_iter::Int64=10) where T <: Float64

"""
analysis   -- string name analysis scheme given to the transform sub-routine
ens        -- ensemble matrix defined by the array with columns given by the replicates of
              the model state
obs        -- observation vector for the current analysis in ensemble_filter / array with
              columns given by the observation vectors for the ordered sequence of analysis
							times in the current smoothing window

kwargs     -- keyword arguments for inflation, parameter estimation or other functionality,
              including integration parameters for the state model in smoothing schemes
"""
```

The type of analysis to be passed to the transform step is specified with the `analysis`
string, with partiuclar analysis methods described below.  Observations for the filter
schemes correspond to information available at a single analysis time giving an observation
of the state vector of type [`VecA`](@ref). The ls (lag-shift) smoothers require an array of
observations of type [`ArView`](@ref) corresponding to all analysis times within the data
assimilation window (DAW). Observation covariances are typed as [`CovM`](@ref) for
efficiency.  State covariance multiplicative inflation and extended state parameter
covariance multiplicative inflation can be specified in `kwargs`. These outer-loops pass the
required values to the [`DataAssimilationBenchmarks.EnsembleKalmanSchemes.transform_R`](@ref)
method that generates the ensemble transform for conditioning on observations. Utility
scripts to generate observation operators, analyze ensemble statistics, etc, are included
in the below.
