# Lorenz-96 model
The classical form for the (single-layer) Lorenz-96 equations are defined as 
$$\frac{\mathrm{d}\pmb{x}}{\mathrm{d} t} = \pmb{f}(\pmb{x}),$$
where for each state component $i\in\{1,\cdots,n\}$,

$$f^i(\pmb{x}) &=-x^{i-2}x^{i-1} + x^{i-1}x^{i+1} - x^i + F$$

such that the components of the vector $\pmb{x}$ are given by the variables $x^i$ with
periodic boundary conditions, $x^0=x^n$, $x^{-1}=x^{n-1}$ and $x^{n+1}=x^{1}$.  The term
$F$ in the Lorenz-96 system is the forcing parameter that injects energy to the model.
With the above definition for the classical Lorenz-96 equations, we define the L96-s model
with additive noise (of scalar covariance) as

$$\frac{\mathrm{d} \pmb{x}}{\mathrm{d} t} = \pmb{f}(\pmb{x}) + s(t)\mathbf{I}_{n}\pmb{W}(t),$$

where $\pmb{f}$ is defined as in the classical equations, $\mathbf{I}_n$ is the
$n\times n$ identity matrix, $\pmb{W}(t)$ is an $n$-dimensional Wiener process and
$s(t):\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a measurable function of (possibly)
time-varying diffusion coefficients. This model is analyzed in-depth for data assimilation
twin experiments in the manuscript
[Grudzien, C. et al. (2020).](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/13/1903/2020/gmd-13-1903-2020.html)
and further details of using the system for data assimilation benchmarks in stochastic
dynamics are discussed there.  The methods in the below define the model equations,
the Jacobian, and the order 2.0 Taylor-Stratonovich scheme derived especially
for statistically robust numerical simulation of the truth twin of the L96-s system.
