Are you developing a new method that you want to test versus other similar learning / estimation schemes in standard benchmarks or do you want to examine the behavior of an existing method within the main code base in a novel context?  Do you want to implement a new state or observation model to benchmark methods in the code base?  Please note that there is no support for operational data assimilation or data assimilation with real data, please see alternatives that exist for that scope.
